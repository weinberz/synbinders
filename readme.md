# synbinders
Code for data analysis and figure generation for Weinberg, Soliman et al. 2024. A compatible python environment can be generated using the included `requirements.txt` file. 

Code depends on data deposited at Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.10480659). Download and unzip data.zip from that repository into the parent directory relative to where this code is placed. Code also depends on locally generated CSV files:
